🛡️ Multi-Channel Digital Arrest & Fraud Scam Detection and Prevention Platform

📖 Overview

Digital fraud scams — especially digital arrest scams — are one of the fastest-growing cybercrimes.  
Scammers use AI-generated voices, deepfakes, spoofed caller IDs, and fake documents to scare victims into paying money or sharing sensitive information.

This project is a complete AI-powered fraud detection and prevention platform that protects users in real time.

What it does:
- Detects scams across SMS, email, calls, and video calls
- Sends instant alerts with risk levels and recommendations
- Generates fraud reports (PDF/Doc) for users and authorities
- Educates users with cyber safety awareness (laws, punishments, quizzes)

✨ Features

Multi-Channel Detection  
- Text Analysis (NLP): Scam SMS, emails, or chats  
- Audio Analysis: Speech-to-text and voice deepfake detection  
- Video Analysis: Detect deepfake videos (blink-rate, lip-sync)  

Real-Time Alerts  
- Instant alerts when scam is detected  
- Explains why flagged (keywords, spoof markers)  
- Provides protection advice  

Reports  
- Downloadable fraud reports in PDF/Doc  
- Contains date, sender info, AI explanation, risk score  
- Useful for police or legal evidence  

Cyber Safety Module  
- Tips for safe banking, emails, and calls  
- Cyber Laws and punishments in India, US, UK, EU  
- Quizzes for user learning  

Dashboard  
- Clean React and Tailwind UI  
- Sections: Home, Alerts, Reports, Tips, Laws, Quiz  
- Real-time risk monitoring

🧠 AI/ML Models

Text Scam Detection: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression to flag scam messages  
Audio Scam Detection: Speech-to-text plus voice spoofing detection  
Video Scam Detection: Blink-rate, lip-sync mismatch, and pretrained models  

🔔 Alerting Mechanism

Example alert JSON:

{
  "type": "audio",
  "risk": "high",
  "reason": "Detected spoofed caller ID + scam keywords",
  "confidence": 0.88,
  "recommendation": "Hang up and call the bank via official helpline"
}

Frontend shows popup alert with risk color coding.  
User can block, report, or download report.  

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React, TailwindCSS  
Backend: FastAPI, MongoDB, ReportLab  
AI/ML: scikit-learn, SpeechRecognition, OpenCV  
Cloud: AWS S3, EC2  

📊 User Flow

1. Scam message, call, or video received  
2. AI/ML model analyzes  
3. Alert displayed with risk level and advice  
4. User downloads fraud report (PDF)  
5. User checks laws, punishments, and learns via quiz

Would you like me to also **add diagrams inside this README** (like user flow and system architecture) in markdown image format so it looks more professional for presentation?
